            <p>Mustafa Yilmaz other known self-choosing name Can may considered 
              as a generalist or a multidisciplinary artist in visual art.</p>
              <br>
          <p>Can creates digital products and experiences with passion and 
              love - yes he can. Aiming for VFX or animation career, he is 
              eager to gain some professional experiences in postproduction. 
              Despite, his works limited by his personal stuffs and some 
              freelance customers, you may say he is self thought 
              art-director. After graduation from film school, Can set a 
              lifetime achievement as cinematograph for himself. I know, he 
              believes the integration of film making and post production
              with ever developed tech.</p>
              <br>
          <p>The words; a nerd, a geek are probably enough to describe him. 
              He likes to integrate his work with programming and AI. 
              And yes, he hates repetitive jobs so he always seek for 
              practical way of doing things.</p>
